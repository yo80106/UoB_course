# Course Projects at UoB
This repository keeps two main projects from my coursework at the University of Brstol. 

- turtle: This folder houses a project that I developed in the "Programming in C" course. This project aimed to design a programming language that was easy for users to understand the concepts of programming. The idea was inspired by an example of the LOGO programming language.
- STAG: This folder stores a project that I developed in the "Object-Oriented Programming with Java" course. This project aimed to design an interactive game that users could take an advanture with text.Â
